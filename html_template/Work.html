			<h1>BOLTHOUSE FARMS: OUTDOOR + BART STATION TAKEOVER</h1>
			<p>As Account Executive on Boathouse Farms, I worked with a producer and team of creatives  to move this project through client approvals, printing and installation. The following video was shot and edited  by the creative team to showcase the environment in the Bart station and the outdoor ads throughout the city.</p>

			OUR APPROACH: Resurrect Gator Gum as Gatorade Gum, a powerful and purposeful gum.  Introducing PERFORMANCE GUM - a new category of gum with the active ingredients, and electrolytes. It is the "while" solution, helping replenish what was lost so users can push through.

			<h1>Challenge Discovery</h1>
			<p>I worked with a team of six to develop a communications strategy and creative executions for a local ropes course, Challenge Discovery. 
			<br>
			<br>
			THE SITUATION: Business was good, just stagnant.
			The community saw Challenge Discovery as just another adventure ropes course even though their offering is much richer than that. </p>
